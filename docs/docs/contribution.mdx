Fireback is an open-source project, and I hope that people who find it useful will be returning bugfixes, and functionalities into
the project. Due to the fact that I use this framework to build software for clients, I have my own priorities from different aspects,
and might not fix or add some specific features until it's very needed.

In this document we discuss what things are needed to be done, and more importantly, what won't happen.
