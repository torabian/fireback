Fireback is reading `.env` file to understand which database connection can it use,
among other configuration such as the http port. In this document we will be discussing
how to config Fireback in different scenarios.

Probably said earlier, `fireback init` command would generate `.env` file, and run some commands
for migration all in one command.

Nevertheless, you can manually create this file. The configuration for this, would become from 
https://github.com/torabian/fireback/blob/main/modules/fireback/WorkspaceModule3.yml
file in the `config` section.

Here we are going to discuss them a bit more in details but check for new configs in that file as well.


```
