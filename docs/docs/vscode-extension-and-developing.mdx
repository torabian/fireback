title: VSCode extension and Developing

For each release, there is a VSCode extension coming with Fireback, which could provide
a visual yaml editor, and autosuggestions. Still on version 1.1.27, The "Run on Save"
plugin is needed, simply to regenerated fireback while saving Module3.yaml files.

I hope on version 1.1.28, VSCode plugin become much better.
