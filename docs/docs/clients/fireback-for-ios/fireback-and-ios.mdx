Fireback projects which are written in Golang, could be used with any kind
of front-end technologies, as they are standard http rest api.
But as you might see, `fireback gen` provides also `swift`.

At the moment, there is a project in `clients/fireback-ios`, and also some code
generation.

There won't be much time invesment on this from 2025 - but this is not cancelled.
If anyone wants to contribute, it's very welcome.
