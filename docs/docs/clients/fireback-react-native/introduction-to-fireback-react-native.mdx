Fireback react native is a raw project to create React native projects.
React and React native SDKs are not the same as Fireback React Native Boilerplate,
This is only a starter app that you might use for your projects.

Fireback React Native is not a complete boilerplate unlike React.js version.
There is not much planned to add features to it at the moment.
