title: Tasks

Tasks, are an important aspect of many projects, they can be cronjobs, or triggered
by an event. Fireback supports such features both internally and connecting with external
services such as SQS.

Fireback generates the tasks on module level, and they are registered across the `*workspaces.FirebackApp`
and accessible through the hole app. The reason is, the task server is single per app, 
and it won't be started by each module independently.

## Purpose of tasks

Tasks, are golang actions, which can be triggered either by a messaging system (event system such as redis) or
triggered automatically with cronjob ticks.

Few examples:

- Postprocesss video, when a user uploads vide. You can define a video post process task.
- Make a cronjob on each night to send marketing emails.

## Define and register tasks

In this example, first we need to create a new Module called `media` and we continue adding tasks
to that file.
By having in MediaModule3.yml, defining tasks could be easily defined via Module3.yml files.
Let's create a postVideoProcessing task:

```yaml
name: media
tasks:
  - name: postProcessVideo
    description: Listens to the post process videos and converts them into different sizes
    in:
      fields:
        - name: videoUniqueId
          type: string
          validate: required
```

This will generated set of codes in `MediaModule.dyno.go`: 

```go
type LicensesTasksContext struct {
	PostProcessVideo func(body *PostProcessVideoTaskParams, tx *workspaces.TaskCtx) error
}

func (x *LicensesTasksContext) GetTasks() []*workspaces.TaskAction {
	return []*workspaces.TaskAction{
		{
			Name: "PostProcessVideo",
			HandlerFunc: func(ctx *workspaces.TaskCtx, content []byte) error {
				var body *PostProcessVideoTaskParams
				if err := json.Unmarshal(content, &body); err != nil {
					return err
				}
				return x.PostProcessVideo(body, &workspaces.TaskCtx{})
			},
            ....
```

There might be more code generated which would be different based on the cronjob definition.

## Using generated tasks

Tasks are **not** being automatically included via modules. You need to go to your `MediaModule.go` and create
a context, and pass them to the Module:

```go
func MediaModuleSetup(cfg *MediaModuleConfig) *workspaces.ModuleProvider {
	// Create the context
	ctx := MediaTasksContext{}
	module := &workspaces.ModuleProvider{
		Name: "media",
        Definitions: &Module3Definitions,

		// Add the following line:
		Tasks: ctx.GetTasks(),
```

Now, all the tasks you have defined will become available in your project.

## Check for list of tasks

Any Fireback app (and itself) would have a `tasks` command. By running list command, you'll see all of the
available tasks in the project:

```bash
ali@alis-MacBook-Pro fireback % ./app tasks list
PostProcessVideo
```

Also you can see the parameters of the task via `enqueue` task

```bash
ali@alis-MacBook-Pro fireback % ./app tasks enqueue PostProcessVideo --help
NAME:
   Fireback core microservice - v1.2.0 tasks enqueue PostProcessVideo - 

USAGE:
   Fireback core microservice - v1.2.0 tasks enqueue PostProcessVideo [command options] [arguments...]

OPTIONS:
   --video-unique-id value  videoUniqueId
```

## Running task server

By default, Fireback is using `github.com/hibiken/asynq` library to manage tasks.
It depends on the redis, and needs to be available on `127.0.0.1:6379` by default.
This can be changed via setting `WORKER_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1:6379` to different one.
There should be a support for SQS later on and easily, you can contribute it to project if you wanted.

Tasks server is not running by default, you need to run it via:

```
./app tasks start
```

You can avoid the separate task server by setting `WITH_TASK_SERVER=true` in env file to true,
then it would be starting with your `./app start` functionality.

# Enqueue a task

While tasks server is running, you can enqueue them via cli or golang.

Via CLI:

```bash
./app tasks enqueue PostProcessVideo --video-unique-id 809182ji392879
```

That might be handly for external events, but you can also trigger that in golang inside any action:

```go
task, err := NewPostProcessVideoTask(&PostProcessVideoTaskParams{
    VideoUniqueId: &uid,
})
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error on enqueue task PostProcessVideo: %w", err)
    return err
}
result, err2 := workspaces.EnqueueTask(task)
if err2 == nil {
    fmt.Println("task is in queue, id: %s", result.ID)
    return nil
}
```

**If a cronjob be added to the action, it would be automatically triggered**:

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: postProcessVideo2
    description: Listens to the post process videos and converts them into different sizes
    in:
      fields:
        - name: videoUniqueId
          type: string
          validate: required
    triggers:
      - cron: '* * * * *'
```

This would add the cron to generated code:

```go
...
    Flags: PostProcessVideo2CommonCliFlagsOptional,
    Triggers: []*workspaces.Module3Trigger{
        {
            Cron: "* * * * *",
        },
    },
...
```

## Other details a tasks need

Obviously, the task manager in Fireback could be much more complicated to support the SQS,
and much more details. I am interested to have those features developed by someone else,
because in projects I do the current solution is enough.
