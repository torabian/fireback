You can define actions, which mostly are similar to defining controller
on MVC frameworks, which would accept a body, and sends a response, usually
as a json format.

Fireback actions will become both accessible using `cli` and `http` server, it means
fireback is wrappering the actions as general functions (rpc) to be called rather than
traditional http request. This would make every action define both available on cli
and server. You can customize this of course, some actions make no sense to be available
on web or cli.

## Defining actions

In any Module3.yml file, you can set array of actions in the root.
