There is an important folder in `modules` folder which is called `fireback`
This folder holds all of the code needed to build a react.js project.

Module we are speaking of is, extreamly opiniated, and you don't have
to use it, and even you don't have to use Fireback React at all,
in the end Fireback go becomes a http server with json request, respones.
