Fireback itself, or any projects, microservices built using fireback can serve on http,
using `fireback start` command. It would lift normal gin http server will all routes.

You can set `PORT` env variable, or set the port in configuration file as well. environment variable
will override the configuration, which overrides 4500 default port.

```bash
ali@alis-MacBook-Pro ~ % fireback start

[GIN-debug] [WARNING] Creating an Engine instance with the Logger and Recovery middleware already attached.

[GIN-debug] [WARNING] Running in "debug" mode. Switch to "release" mode in production.
 - using env:	export GIN_MODE=release
 - using code:	gin.SetMode(gin.ReleaseMode)

[GIN-debug] GET    /socket.io/*any           --> github.com/gin-gonic/gin.WrapH.func1 (4 handlers)
[GIN-debug] POST   /socket.io/*any           --> github.com/gin-gonic/gin.WrapH.func1 (4 handlers)
[GIN-debug] GET    /books                    --> pixelplux.com/fireback/modules/books.HttpQueryBooks (4 handlers)
...
```

If you are running fireback itself, you can see an open api document on `http://localhost:4500/docs`
and also fireback administration ui on `http://localhost:4500`.

For projects built manually you might need to create your own UI and place it into your binary,
if thats how you would like to distribute UI.

## Load as system service


In the end, if you want to run a http server, you need to find a way to register it
as a system service to run on background. Fireback already comes with this functionality
using `fireback service`. You can use load, reload, unload commands.


```
fireback service load
```

Similarly, to stop or reload, for example when `.env` configuration has been changed.

```
fireback service stop
fireback service reload
```

Your Fireback project also has the service ready:

```
./app service load
```
