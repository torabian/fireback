The `Module3Dto` struct represents a Data Transfer Object (DTO) in an application. DTOs are versatile and can be used for various purposes, such as request and response objects for actions or even internally within the application. Fireback generates a variety of helper functions for each DTO, making it beneficial to define them in `Module3` instead of as pure Go structs.

Example in Module3 yaml.

```yaml
dtos:
  - name: userRoleWorkspacePermission
    fields:
      - name: workspaceId
        type: string
      - name: userId
        type: string
      - name: roleId
        type: string
      - name: capabilityId
        type: string
      - name: type
        type: string
```


## Fields

### `Name`
- **Type:** `string`
- **Description:**  
  The name of the DTO in camel case. Fireback generates all related code for the DTO based on this name.

---

### `Fields`
- **Type:** `[]*Module3Field`
- **Description:**  
  Defines the list of fields and body structure for the DTO. Each field represents a specific part of the data contained within the DTO.
