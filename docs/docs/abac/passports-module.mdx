Fireback provides a core user system for every project. Fireback project tends to be complete in itself,
therefor ABAC solution is built right into it.

For almost every interaction with Fireback or projects built with it, you need to be authenticated. This authentication
is basically a token, which defines what kind of access level current session has.

Because most of fireabck actions are written in specific workspace by a user, generally all actions of an entity
are locked to that feature. You can have of course public access scope on an entity, for example public newsletter
sign up without authentication or some statisics if needed.

## What passport entity is

Passport entity represents a tool such as email address, or phone number, or could be a google login
to authenticate a user. Passports belong to the root, and modifying them is only other custom actions
such as signup, change passport and more.

Passports do not have authentication level, they just verify that the user is what who pretends he is, and 
in theory each user can have multiple passports, they can extra email to their user account or remove, although
this feature might not be available in current version, database design supports it.

## Passport method

Passport method is another table in the database, which would define what method of authentication are available
in the project, and modifying it is also root access only. Using passport method, you can define very specific authentication options, remove an option, or specifiy different methods for different countries.

This section is accessible via `fireback passport method` command.

## Login via CLI

After creating a new project - or just installing pure Fireback itself - you need to initialize an environment.
This could be done by `fireback init` or `./app init` if you are in your own project.

If you continue the prompt questions, they will ask you about a admin user, with a name or last name. This command is independently available on `fireback passport new` function, which would create a user, workspace, assign roles,
generate a token and authenticate the cli with that. Current authenticated user could be show by `fireback ws view`
which would export a lot of different details of current user access.
