Fireback is coming with a complete ABAC system, which would manage data ownership,
actions permission (to manage different roles within a project) by default.

Although this might not be very interesting for those who like to control everything,
I promise if you follow along, Fireback can support even very complex role-permision 
scenarios.

Capabilities are managed using `fireback cap` cli tool, and also some http api are
provided as well.
