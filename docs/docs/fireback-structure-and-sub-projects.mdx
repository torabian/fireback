title: Fireback structure and sub projects
sidebar_position: 43
---

Fireback original project (and subsequent projects built using Fireback) all follow a the same or very similar
structure.

**Note:** This document might be useful for developers who want to understand Fireback more deeper,
you don't need it for building your apps using Fireback.

Fireback is simple, and in fact doesn't contain so many folders anyway.

## .github

This folder contains github actions build for Fireback framework.
Might be present in projects created via Fireback. Delete it if your project
does not being deployed via Github or hosted there, also you can modify
your own apps version to your needs.

## .jsonschemas (ignored)

Fireback and Fireback projects generate jsonschemas out of Module3.yml files.
This is because, I wanted to have more sophisticated generated autocompletion
per each module, but not used yet. This folder will be generated
on Fireback and Fireback projects, and can be removed via Makefile of the project.

**Reminder** You need to install Redhat Yaml VSCode extension to see autocompletion
for Module3 files.

## .vscode

This is also present in both new projects and Fireback itself, which contains
a set of tasks, settings for working on Fireback projects. Feel free
to extend or modify it based on your needs.

## artifacts (ignored)

Fireback makefiles are configured to create artifacts for different operating
systems inside this folder. It's ignored and will be auto generated.

## cmd

A command golang community convention for having application entry points.
Check the `main.go` to see further configurations.

By default, might be only a single app, but you can add new folders here and make 
multiple application by combining different modules, just as you would with any
golang application.

## docs

Documents related to Fireback.

## e2e

Tests, and some scripts needed for Fireback project itself. It doesn't
exist on child projects

## modules

This folder is the most imporant folder in Fireback projects, and you 
can create your `Module3.yml` modules here. In VSCode, CMD+SHIFT+P and `Run task`
will suggest `Generate new module` to create them easier.

It exists on Fireback and child projects.
