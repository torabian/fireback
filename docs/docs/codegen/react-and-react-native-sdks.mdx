As React.js is the dominant framework of the web development, (as well as desktop and other platforms) nowadays,
Fireback targets the React.js as primary framework, both for it's UI and creating subsequent projects.

Now fireback comes with a react.js project on https://github.com/torabian/fireback/tree/main/modules/fireback/codegen/react-new

But **SDKs** we are talking about here is a different part of framework. In Fireback and every app created with it,
there is a section called `gen` which would give you few options, and `fireback gen react` is responsible for exporting the SDKs for both react.js and react native.

## What is SDK and it's content

The SDK which you can generate does not contain UI code, or guidelines. It's gonna be a code created
to call http requests, socket requests, and export Dtos, and Entities. Anything which is exposed through 
entities actions, pure actions, dtos, and other details will become Typescript and React hooks automatically.

In a nutshell, in version 1.2.1 content will be generated:

* Entities will become pure Typescript classes (not interfaces)
* Entities will contain a `Field` static object, which is a string representation of DTO or Entity
so all fields are typed
* React query hooks based on `v3.39.3` will be generated. It's important to know that,
I might update that to use with newer version without a notice, but so far there is no plan for that.
* Set of react context provider for keeping the authentication information.
* A set of code to keep a store on the UI - removing the need for caching and store such as redux.

## Using generated sdk in a plain react.js app

In this section, let's go an use Fireback react sdk in a pure empty react.js app which we want to build from
group zero. 

You can use your own app, here we are just using plain `fireback` itself to generate sdk:

```bash
fireback gen react --path src/sdk
```

Now, we will have a folder called `sdk` and inside it will be two folders called `core` and `modules`.
The generated SDK will have the same structure as backend in terms of `modules` folder.
For each modules, it's flat and DTOs and Entities are being exported regardless.

Fireback SDK for react is highly dependant on react-query@v3, it's considered you already
have installed it. In case you have different version installed on your project, it's up to you
separate them somehow make sure SDK can access the v3 because there is no plan to update it in Fireback
for backward compatibility yet.

You need to Provide QueryClientProvider in your app, Fireback doesn't. Then under that, you need to
provide RemoteQueryProvider from Fireback. `RemoteQueryProvider` function has it's own set of props,
which we'll explain later in this document.

```
import { useRef } from "react";
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "react-query";
import { RemoteQueryProvider } from "./sdk/core/react-tools";

function App() {
  const queryClient = useRef(new QueryClient());
  return (
    <div className="App">
        <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient.current}>
          <RemoteQueryProvider
            identifier="fireback"
            queryClient={queryClient.current}
          >
            <SignupTest />
          </RemoteQueryProvider>
          <QueryCapabilitiesTest />
        </QueryClientProvider>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

```

# **IRemoteQueryProvider Interface**

The `IRemoteQueryProvider` interface defines the structure and options for integrating the Fireback SDK with React Query. Below is a detailed explanation of its properties:


### **`children`** (optional)  
- **Type**: `React.ReactNode`  
- **Description**:  
  Represents the rest of your application that will have access to the SDK.  
  Ensure that the React Query provider is placed outside and pass the `queryClient` via the `queryClient` prop.  

---

### **`remote`** (optional)  
- **Type**: `string`  
- **Description**:  
  The web server address the app will connect to.  
  Update this value based on the environment (development/production).  
  **Important**: Always include a trailing slash, e.g., `remote="http://localhost:4500/"`. Fireback does not add the slash for you.

---

### **`preferredAcceptLanguage`** (optional)  
- **Type**: `string`  
- **Description**:  
  Sets the `Accept-Language` header for all requests.  
  Use this to override auto-detection of the userâ€™s language.  
  Ideal if users select their preferred language manually.

---

### **`identifier`** (required)  
- **Type**: `string`  
- **Description**:  
  A unique identifier for saving SDK caches in `localStorage`.  
  Use your app name here to avoid cache collisions, especially in development environments.

---

### **`selectedUrw`** (optional)  
- **Type**: `UserRoleWorkspace`  
- **Description**:  
  Tracks the user's current role and workspace.  
  After authentication, store and update this information to send role and workspace IDs with headers automatically.  
  Update the `selectedUrw` object if users can switch workspaces or roles.

---

### **`token`** (optional)  
- **Type**: `string`  
- **Description**:  
  Provide the authentication token (stored in `localStorage`) after authenticating the client.  
  This is crucial for apps with multiple SDKs to share the same token.  
  **Note**: If the app is fully public, this token can be omitted unless forced by specific functions.

---

### **`queryClient`** (optional)  
- **Type**: `QueryClient`  
- **Description**:  
  Pass the same `QueryClient` object provided to `QueryClientProvider`.  
  This stores caches and other necessary data for React Query.

---

### **`defaultExecFn`** (optional)  
- **Type**: `any`  
- **Description**:  
  Override the default HTTP call function for custom behaviors (e.g., using a mock server).  
  **Example**:  
  ```typescript
  defaultExecFn={() => {
    return (options: any) => mockExecFn(options, mockServer.current);
  }}


```
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "react-query";

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

const App = () => {
  return (
    <IRemoteQueryProvider
      remote="http://localhost:4500/"
      identifier="myApp"
      preferredAcceptLanguage="en-US"
      token="user-auth-token"
      queryClient={queryClient}
      socket={true}
      prefix="/api/v1"
      defaultExecFn={customExecFunction}
    >
      {/* Rest of your application goes here */}
      <YourAppComponents />
    </IRemoteQueryProvider>
  );
};

export default App;

```

## Benefit of the generated SDK

As you might notice one of the major features are Fireback is that it's capable of
saving json objects into normalized sql database. The fact that you define entities,
makes multiple tables and link them with foreign keys automatically.

It means on a developer level, you are working with your json, posting it to server,
but generated code will split that into their own tables. Implementing this manually
for all entities and endpoints is the major motivation for having unstructed databases
such as mongodb in a project.

What is important that, the json UI works with, to be always in sync with what backend
is expecting. For example, if a field has been removed, UI should not be able to compile
or even if it has got a different type.

For this purpose, we generate a on each DTO or Entity class a static field called `Fields`.
This object contains the signature of the dto/entity, but as javascript.

Consider the `WorkspaceEntit.ts` and field section:

```typescript
public static Fields = {
  ...BaseEntity.Fields,
  description: `description`,
  name: `name`,
  typeId: `typeId`,
  type$: `type`,
  type: WorkspaceTypeEntity.Fields,
};
```

As you see all of the fields are accessible as a Javascript object, so in form creation you can use:

```
void form.setFieldValue(WorkspaceEntity.Fields.name, 'new-name')
```
