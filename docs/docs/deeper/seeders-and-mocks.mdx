In many projects there are requirement to fullfil database with some static content, as if they are a part of program.
Fireback emphasizes a lot on moving data into database. Even for male/female selection, it would be benefitial to move them
into a table in database and not add them in to the codebase or hardcode on front-end.

This makes fireback databases extreamly robust, and allows to rewrite application in upcoming decades if a new or better programming
language appears. Also helps translations, localisation, whitelabling easier, and you can imagine the rest.

To make this easier, we provide 2 concepts of `seeders` and `mocks`. Seeders, are the content, usually have a specific uniqueid,
and you can sync them into the database. Such as timezones, they are useful in most projects. Mocks on the other hands,
are a way of creating test data. Imagine you want to simulate list of products, but specific ones, you'll add them
as mocks part of each entity.

From technical point of view, both of them are yaml files (might be json as well, but coverage is not tested.). They need to follow
such signature:

```
resources:
- key: anyThingAsKey
  path: ./file1.png // This is relative to the yml file, which will be placed in embed in go
  blob: true/false // If true, it would be stored as blob. Useful with xfile? datatype.

content:
- anyKey: ($ref:anyThingAsKey) or ($refblob:anyThingAsKey)
... add as many as items you want.
```

When you create entities, there will be mocks and seeders folders for that entity as well created on the module,
and if you place files there the `mlist`, `slist`, `msync` and `ssync` commands will appear.

**These commands are not available on http** for security purposes at the moment, and it's quite impractical to have them.
This could be argued though, lets say the admin can check the seeders or mocks via ui.
