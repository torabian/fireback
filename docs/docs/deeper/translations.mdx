Fireback is coming with internaionlization in mind, on backend, database level, and front-end.
In this document we are gonna discuss the strategies, tools and other important info regarding.

## Translation in commercial projects

I've seen a lot of projects start in local language, and after a while they need to modify nearly
all files in the application. The decision "This app doesn't need to be translated" is a dangerous thought
from time perspective, because:

- You can't be sure this project won't need translations, things change over time
- You build components that are not that portable. Even though this project doesn't need translation,
some sections of it could be easily used somewhere else if you built it through
- Project is not really modular after all.

## Translation of the content

Fireback allows a field called `translate: true` on entities root fields. When you apply translate to a field
in an entity, there will be a second table created for it. For example Fireback capability entity:

```yaml
  - name: capability
    cliShort: cap
    security:
      writeOnRoot: true
    description: >-
      Manage the capabilities inside the application, both builtin to core and
      custom defined ones
    fields:
      - name: name
        type: string
      - name: description
        type: string
        translate: true
```

As you see, the description will be translated. Fireback creates a table called `fb_capability_entity_polyglots`,
and adds all those fields which are marked as translated,

**Note:** At 1.2.0 only root fields are being translated
**Note:** Using such translation requires you always join the table with translation table. This might affect
the import/export performance or custom query strategies.

## Translating errors and other strings in backend

Fireback for backend uses concept of `messages` for translating in backend. Basically, any string
which might need translation is a message, and it's discussed in it's own document [Messages](../messages.mdx)

Simply, you put all strings and translations into the yaml file, and use them in your go code. Fireback helps
to use the correct translation based on locale by default.

## Translating on front-end

Fireback also provides a tool called `fireback gen strings` which could be used to generate typescript
translations (or other languages in future) from yaml files.
