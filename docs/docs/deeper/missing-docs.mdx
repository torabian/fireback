## Macros
Macros are a Fireback Module3 definition feature, which would add extra
features into a definition, by just using them.

## Migration and databases
Fireback or Projects generated by fireback, they need database. Fireback is based on Gorm,
and only supports What gorm supports. Code generated, or SQL queries, are only
optimized or even generated for SQLite and MySQL, since I do not build anything
outside of these 2 databases.

You might be able to connect your golang project to another type of database,
since fireback is pure go, there is not conflict, but you won't gen benefit of
entities or migration out of the box.
