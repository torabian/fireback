XHtml is a output type in Fireback actions, which returns an html template.
You an create html files in a folder, embed them, and then XHtml would render them.
Upon development, they are being read from disk, and on productio they are read from embed file system.

XHtml is perfect answer for the classic get/postback forms, you can make an endpoint to show your page,
or accept a post back content and do some action on top of it.


All you need to do on an action is, to set the `out.xhtml` to true:


```yaml
...
actions:
   - name: getHome
     url: /
     method: get
     out:
       xhtml: true
   - name: postHome
     url: /
     method: post
     out:
       xhtml: true
     in:
       fields:
       - name: firstName
         type: string

```

When the action file is being generated, there are some helper commands for you to understand how to return
the screen name, and parameters.

This tutorial defintely worth a workshop in a video form.
