There are many libraries for styling front-end (html) projects introduced. I remember once less/mess was popular,
and of course scss, sass, css-in-js, style component, and some other ideas come and go time to time.
In this situation, sticking to pure css, with a bit tool which can bundle, minify, and resolve the import paths
can both help the modularity, and the fact that the same files, without discussions, can be used for decades.

## Fireback cssx misc command

Fireback comes with a handy misc command, which can combine and minify the css files into a single output.
That's useful, when you want to use an entry point, such as styles.css, and then include couple of more files,
using `@import url` syntax, and finally have a `styles.min.css`.


```
ali@alis-MacBook-Pro fireback % ./app misc cssx --help
NAME:
   Fireback core microservice - v1.2.3 misc cssx - Minifies css file, and resolves the @import dependencies recursively

USAGE:
   Fireback core microservice - v1.2.3 misc cssx [command options] [arguments...]

DESCRIPTION:
   Minifies css file, and resolves the @import dependencies recursively

OPTIONS:
   --entry-point value  Absolute or relative path of the css entry point file on the disk
   --out value          output file address. If left empty, it will write result to stdout
   --skip-minify        If true, would skip minifying the css result file
   
```

The command supports `@import url()` and `@import ""` formats, with `.css` extensions. To avoid printing to file,
skip providing `--out` argument.
