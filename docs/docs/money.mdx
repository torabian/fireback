Working with money and amounts is one of the requirements in almost in every application.
Many times you want to store or parse amounts (value + currency) in database, for a product price,
or other reasons.

Fireback provides a datatype, called Money. It's accessible using `money?` since version 1.2.4.

```yaml
entities:
  - name: table1
    fields:
    - name: amount
      type: money?
```

Defining a field with `money?` type causes that `fireback.Money` struct to be used, which is representing 
a amount. You can provide the amount as a string, both in cli and http post requests:

```yaml
amount:
    amount: 100
    currency: usd
```

also, both in yaml and json, it's accepted to send string:

```yaml
amount: 100$
```

and the field will be automatically converted. Money struct provides a set of helper functions as well, such as:

```go
package home2

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/torabian/fireback/modules/fireback"
)

func init() {

	fmt.Println(fireback.NewMoneyAutoNull("100$").Plus("200$").Format("en-us"))

	// prints $300.00
}
```
