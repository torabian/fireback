The fact that Fireback generates some useful queries as well as presence of the Gorm
orm, is nothing in comparison of the power of writing custom SQL queries.

In reality, ORM are not an answer to the query need. Even with Fireback and Gorm,
they become slow and quickly can be calling database multiple times. For any serious query
you need to have manual access and tune that.

Fireback provides a `queries` array in any Module3 files, and will generate the necessary code
to interact with the query.

Consider the following query:

```yaml
queries:
  - columns:
      fields:
        - name: name
          type: string
    description: Sample SQL Query which would map the result into the golang struct
    name: sample
    query: 
      select 'Ali' as 'name'
```

It's very clear but worth to mention that `columns` are the result of the query as an array mapped
automatically. Also the `query` column is a golang template, which will be converted into
sql prior to execuation.

`name` will be used to generate the sql file, as well as `description` for documentation.

In the Module.dyno.go file, you'll see a golang generated code as well as `Sample.vsql` file.

```go
func SampleQuery(query fireback.QueryDSL) ([]*SampleQueryColumns, *fireback.QueryResultMeta, error) {
	refl := reflect.ValueOf(&SampleQueryColumns{})
	items, meta, err := fireback.ContextAwareVSqlOperation[SampleQueryColumns](
		refl, &queries.QueriesFs, "Sample.vsql", query,
	)
	return items, meta, err
}
```

Now you can call this in your go functions, or Fireback actions.

**Passing parameters are one of the most requested features** but yet not available.
