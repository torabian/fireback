The code generated on fireback are mostly a set of functions and helpers which do not run by themselves.
Entities, Actions, and more things generated are usually added as a list array into a FirebackApp struct,
and then you can run it as an application.

In theory, you could have multiple instances of FirebackApp running in the same app, but this has not been tested
and for sure there is a single database connection per workspaces, and there is no plan to refactor that.

When you create a new Fireback project, you'll see `var xapp = &workspaces.FirebackApp{` has been created
in the `main.go` and some configurations are there.
