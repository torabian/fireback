# Entities in Fireback

As might be discussed in other documents, entities are tables in database, similar to Entity Framework
and other ORMs concept of 'entity', which is a table mapped to a class or struct in the programming language.

The major difference between Fireback entities is, it provides functionality by default on top of the entity,
which could be used directly as http api or cli, without creating much controller. Every entity supposed
to be able to be created easily, updated, deleted, obey permission role requirements.
