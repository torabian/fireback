Fireback is written based on the GORM library, so it can support connecting out of the box to the following database.

You can update the database config interactively, using `fireback config db`,
and it would open a prompt and guide you to set the database parameters.

```bash
ali@alis-MacBook-Pro fireback % fireback config db
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ← 
? Database type: 
  ▸ sqlite (:memory:)
    sqlite
    mysql
    postgres
```

*Important:* SQLite memory database only lives until the server is closed.

This interactive command would later modify the configuration file, (usually `fireback-configuration.yml` or `yourproject-configuration.yml` file)
with following possible data:

## Mysql

Connecting to mysql is done by providing normal credentials, and database name.

```yaml
database:
  vendor: mysql
  database: mydb
  username: root
  password: root
  host: localhost
  port: 3306
```

## Sqlite

SQLite is a file based database system, and you just need to specifiy the path of the file, and `Vendor` to `sqlite`

In your `config.yml`

```yaml
database:
  vendor: sqlite
  database: /tmp/fireback.db
```

## Postgres

Postgres is also supported in fireback, (CTE and Pivot queries might be covered in later versions)
and you can use `fireback config db`
