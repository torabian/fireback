title: First fireback project
sidebar_position: 3

In this document, we are going to create a new project, and build it both on golang side, and react.js side. Also we are going to build the project,
and configurate the database connection.

## Make sure you have installed the fireback.

You can install fireback either via binaries, or `go install` command which is explained on 
[Download and install Fireback](./download-and-install-fireback.mdx)

## Create a new project

You can use `fireback new` command to generate a new project. If you provide some arguments, you can
do it without interactive questions.

Creating a new project contains go files for backend project, vscode configuration and tasks, if you wanted
capacitor project wrapper, react.js front-end, and react native app boiler plate.

Please consider there are iOS and Android project in [Fireback clients folder](https://github.com/torabian/fireback/tree/main/clients) that you might copy and use yourself, but since they are incomplete, they are 
not yet a part of the Fireback `new` command.

**React native** project is not a complete boilerplate, it would be improving overtime. React.js project
is a main focus, and could be easily wrapped into a Cordova or Capacitor.

## Important: new vs init

Fireback `new` command would create a new repository for your project, but `init` would initialize a new environment (.env) file to have variables, database connection, third party API keys.


## Fireback new options

By running `fireback new` command alone, a set of interactive questions will appear. But for more details, you can check `fireback new --help`, which will provide:

```bash
NAME:
    new - Generate a new fireback project or microservice.

USAGE:
    new [command options] [arguments...]

OPTIONS:
   --name value         Name of the project that you want to create.
   --path value         The directory that new project will be created. If not entered, project name will be used
   --micro              If the new project is a micro service - default is false, and we create monolith
   --ui                 If you set --ui true, there will be a front-end project also added.
   --mobile             If you set --mobile true, there will be a application project also added for react native
   --capacitor          If you set --capacitor true, fireback adds capacitor project compatible with front-end (react)
   --description value  Description of the project which would appear in few places (default: "Backend project built by Fireback")
   --module value       Module name of the go.mod - project comes with go modules. for example --module github.com/you/project
   --replace-fb value   Replace fireback with a local copy inside or outside project (if you ejected the fireback)
```


You can modify a set of arguments while creating a new project. `--name` is the project name, which would be also
the folder name. All Lowercase string is standard. 

`--path` is the directory which will the project be created.
By default it's the current folder. 

`--micro` will make the project as a microservice, without much Fireback
authentication. Useful for light services do not need ABAC services.

`--ui` means adding react.js project as well into the project, userful for webview apps and web project itself.
The same exact code is used for the fireback interface, which would be a starting point for you.

`--mobile` would create the react native project. React native project has similar structure to react.js,
but it's still under non focused development.

`--capacitor` would create a simple capacitor directory with some config, to convert the `ui` folder output
easily into a capactior project. It won't contain any UI code, just the built artifacts will go there.

`--description` is project description, which would appear in the CLI tools and OpenAPI docs, and some other places

`--replace-fb` is very important tool to use a custom version of Fireback for your project. As you know, 
you can modify the fireback, and you can have your own version. Using this command, there will be a change in
go.mod which would replace the fireback with a local directory instead of go pkg. 

`--module` it's also a required and important parameter, which is identical to golang module name, often started with `github.com/yourname/yourproject`, it would be applied to `go.mod` file.


## Make the project and init

Project will be compiled as a standard golang project, also if you call `make` command it would 
build it for you, just a very simple helper. The goal of Fireback is to not be anything special other 
than an standard golang project.

After you built your binary, you need to call `fireback init` interactive cli command to generate a `.env` file
with some configuration. This tool would help you setup a lot of details for your project.
