## Overview

Fireback's workspaces module includes a built-in authentication system. Whether you use this system or integrate external user management services like Salesforce or Keycloak, authentication is required for both HTTP and CLI access.

For projects or microservices where the ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control) system is unnecessary, you can authorize the project using a root account. In this case, all operations will be performed as the root user.

## Creating an Account

When initializing a new environment with `fireback init` or `./app init`, the interactive CLI will prompt you to create a new user with a passport and assign it to the root workspace.

**The root workspace is always created and cannot be removed.**

To create a new account via CLI and authenticate:

```bash
fireback passport new
```

Alternatively, you can use:

```bash
fireback user new
```

This command creates a new user, assigns it to the root workspace, and authenticates the CLI with the generated workspace and token.

If you prefer a non-interactive setup, check the available options with:

```bash
fireback user new --help
```

### Command Options:
```bash
NAME:
   Fireback core microservice - v1.1.28 user new - Creates a user interactively and sets credentials in the workspace config

USAGE:
   Fireback core microservice - v1.1.28 user new [command options] [arguments...]

OPTIONS:
   --in-root                  Assign the user to the root group
   --value value              User value
   --workspace-type-id value  Workspace type ID (e.g., 'root')
   --type value               Authentication type ('phonenumber', 'email')
   --password value           Password
   --first-name value         First name
   --last-name value          Last name
```

## Signing in with Different Accounts

To sign in to a user account, use:

```bash
fireback passport auth
```

Or:

```bash
fireback user auth
```

For non-interactive authentication, check the available options:

```bash
fireback user auth --help
```

### Command Options:
```bash
NAME:
   Fireback core microservice - v1.1.28 user auth - Signs in a user with passport and password, storing credentials in the environment for CLI usage

USAGE:
   Fireback core microservice - v1.1.28 user auth [command options] [arguments...]

OPTIONS:
   --value value     User value
   --password value  Password
   --wid value       Workspace ID (if the user belongs to multiple workspaces). If not set, the CLI will prompt for selection.
```

## Difference Between `passport up` and `passport in`

Fireback provides two CLI commands: `passport up` and `passport in`. These commands create an account or sign in, respectively. However, they differ from `passport auth` and `passport new`:

- `passport up` and `passport in` are designed for public HTTP requests and include additional details.
- These commands **do not** change the CLI state; they only facilitate Fireback's HTTP request handling within the CLI.
