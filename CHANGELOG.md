# v1.1.28

Add's the React.js and React native project building. For example:

To create a 'front-end' folder inside project with react.js:
```
fireback new --ui
```

Similar, you can add also a react native project inside the new project:
```
fireback new --mobile
```

Both projects will have a similar structure, and include a copy of fireback UI components,
hooks, and you can modify them.
