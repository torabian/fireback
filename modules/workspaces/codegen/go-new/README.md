# Fireback project

Welcome to the fireback project. You need to use "Makefile" and make commands to build your project.

For building app, fireback does not provide any cli. It's pure golang as is.

## VSCode helper extensions

For better experience, install "emeraldwalk.RunOnSave" for vscode. Check .vscode folder,
When you edit a Module3.yml file it would automatically build it. You can change those settings by yourself.

## Creating new module

There is a task for vscode to create modules easier, use CMD+SHIFT+P and type in "Tasks: Run Task" and select
"Generate new module"
