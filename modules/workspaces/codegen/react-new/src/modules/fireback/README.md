# Fireback for react.js support

This is a set of components for fireback which would help to build the admin panel for fireback
project, or your project.

I would recommend not to modify anything here, if you want to get the updates from fireback ui,
but if you do so it's fine because there is no plan to build complex UI elements
and ship them for projects, since UI of each project is highly different from another
one and people tend to modify due to business requirements every part of the app.

There is no plan to have it as backward compatible in UI section. (generated sdk is not ui, and 
will be backward compatible.)
