# Fireback capacitor

This is a wrapper which would work with front-end code which is generated by fireback ui (react).

Make sure you will add `ios` and `android` platforms using default capacitor commands

Check the Makefile and replace the code build on front-end, if you want to run this standalone.

Also Fireback CLI has a capacitor template generator, you do not need to copy or modifiy this example
if you want to build a capacitor app.
