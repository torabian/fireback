A lot of project nowadays are looking for a way to share
the components between multiple projects.

Fireback is not recommending nor being negative about it; 
anyway we think that there are common components in a lot of
projects and its' better to keep them in shared library.

If one day you wanted to publish them as a separate module,
at least you will only take the shared-library folder.
