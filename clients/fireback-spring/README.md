# Fireback for Spring Boot [Under development]

This repository is a re-write or "competetor" repository for Fireback Go. It seems a lot of features
from fireback are considered amazing for Java developers, but they also want to write their code still
in Java language for business reasons which are making limits to the choice of language they have.

All the codegen created, will be coming from golang version. Building tools for other languages, even backend,
is on the go cli shoulder and this is not intended to change for now, since cli tools work best on the ecosystem.

**If you have the freedom of choice about technology, try Fireback Go instead**

## Using Fireback go binary

Fireback go is my main focus for delivering backends, and it seems rewriting 100+ more routes once again would
be kinda difficult at this point. Fireback Spring, will be a webserver, plus CLI support, and somehow will
be connecting go and java together for the project (I need to figure it out)

## Tools to be supported:

- Ready to deploy as a webserver
- Ready to be used as a cli
- Continue building the backend as complete as possible with the same Go version
